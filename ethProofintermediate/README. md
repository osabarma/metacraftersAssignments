# Solidity Smart Contract

## Description

This project presents a Solidity smart contract showcasing various error-handling mechanisms: `require`, `revert`, and `assert`. These mechanisms are used to enforce access control and handle conditions within the contract.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To get started with this contract:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have a Solidity development environment set up, such as Remix or Truffle.

### Executing program

Follow these steps to work with the contract:

1. Compile the contract using your chosen development environment.

2. Deploy the contract to a blockchain network, like Ethereum, using your preferred deployment tool.

3. Interact with the contract using the provided functions (`withRequire`, `withRevert`, `withAssert`) to observe the different error-handling mechanisms in action.
